# Watson-personal-insights-node-whithout-SDK
Access Watson personal insights with node.js avoiding SDK.
Sometimes, we can need access Watson tools, but there are programation languages where we canÂ´t use SDK.
In Node.js you allways have access to IBM SDK, but in my case I have the need in Navision using only a HttpRequest,
and doing this example of node.js without SDK, could be applied to many other programation languages.
Pre-requisites: Node.js and only Node.js
Files descriptions:
- ApiKey - Example.json- Example to make you own ApiKey.json.
- WatsonPersonalityInsights.js. Script.
- Resp.json. Response from the service.

You can dowload Profile.json from IBM site:
